## Description

Created a portfolio page with semantic elements and css styles.

Work includes:
- writing HTML code and content, including pictures, outgoing links, and navigation bar
- designing layout and colors
- utilizing flexbox properties and media queries
- sticky positioned heading, pseudo-elements, and pseudo-classes
- customized contact form

## Usage

Navigation bar links to relevant content below. About Me contains outgoing link to GitHub page. Project images are outgoing links to deployed pages, though three are placeholders until I've created more applications. Contact Me form has no JavaScript, but to hit the submit button, the inputs and text areas must be filled.

## Visuals
